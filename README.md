# p3at\_for\_ros\_with\_modelsdf
IF YOU DO NOT NEED TO VIEW YOUR ROBOT MODEL ON RVIZ, YOU CAN USE SDF FILES INSTEAD OF URDF FILES TO DESCRIBE YOUR ROBOT FOR GAZEBO.  
YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR ROBOT IN GAZEBO FROM ROS WITH MODEL.SDF.
YOU CAN GET 
A sample model.sdf of pioneer3at for using it in combination with ROS.
Yes, the model.sdf is including gazebo\_ros libraries.

## ROBOTS
Pioneear3at\_ros and Pioneer2dx\_ros are imported from the gazebo models.  
quadrotor\_ros was imported from ![tu-darmstad](https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/hector_quadrotor).
centaur\_ros was imported from ![tu-darmstad](https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/centaur_robot_tutorial).

2. Build this package.  

    $ cd  
    $ git clone https://github.com/m-shimizu/p3at_for_ros_with_modelsdf  
    $ cd p3at_for_ros_with_modelsdf/src  
    $ catkin_init_workspace  
    $ cd ..  
    $ catkin_make  
    
## How to use a gound type robot    
You need 2 terminals for spawning a robot and controlling the robot.  

    Terminal 1(To spawn a robot):  

    $ cd p3at_for_ros_with_modelsdf  
    $ source setup.bash  
    $ roslaunch gazebo_ros_sdf empty.launch  
    (Then spawn a robot "pioneer3at_ros" from "INSERT TAB")
    
    Terminal 2(To control the robot):  

    $ rostopic list
    $ rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py cmd_vel:=/pioneer3at_ros/cmd_vel

## How to fly with a quadrotor  
You need 3 terminals for spawning a robot and controlling the robot.  

    Terminal 1(To spawn a robot):  

    $ cd p3at_for_ros_with_modelsdf  
    $ source setup.bash  
    $ roslaunch gazebo_ros_sdf empty.launch  
    (Then spawn a robot "quadrotor_ros" from "INSERT TAB")
    
    Terminal 2(To control the robot):  

    $ cd p3at_for_ros_with_modelsdf  
    $ source setup.bash  
    $ roslaunch hector_quadrotor_teleop buffalo_gamepad.launch robot:=quadrotor_ros  
     (AND PUSH No.4 BUTTON TO START!!)  
     (You can also use logitech_gamepad.launch or sony_dualshock3.launch or xbox_controller.launch, and you should read them to find whch button is for start.)  
    
    Terminal 3(To watch the camera view of the robot):  

    $ cd p3at_for_ros_with_modelsdf  
    $ source setup.bash  
    $ rostopic list | grep quadrotor_ros | grep image
    $ rosrun image_view2 image_view2 image:=/quadrotor_ros/camera_ros/image  
## How to get an experience with a centaur robot
You need 2 terminals for spawning a robot and controlling the robot.  

    Terminal 1(To spawn a robot):  

    $ cd p3at_for_ros_with_modelsdf  
    $ source setup.bash  
    $ roslaunch gazebo_ros_sdf empty.launch world:=cenaur.world
    (A centaur_ros model will be spawned and initialized in pose automatically)
    
    Terminal 2(To move the robot):  

    $ rostopic list
    $ rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py cmd_vel:=/centaur_ros/cmd_vel_raw
    
    To control other joints of the robot, use a trajectory controller that was opened with the gazebo.
    You can use the trajectory controller heuristically.
    Try it!

## How to fly with a quadrotor  
You need 3 terminals for spawning a robot and controlling the robot.  

## How to get an experience with a thermal camera  
You need 2 terminals for spawning a robot and controlling the robot.

    Terminal 1(To spawn a robot):  

    $ cd p3at_for_ros_with_modelsdf  
    $ source setup.bash  
    $ roslaunch gazebo_ros_sdf empty.launch world:=where_is_hot.world  
    (pioneer2dx_ros will be spawned automatically)
    
    Terminal 2:  

    $ rostopic list
    $ rosrun image_view2 image_view2 image:=/pioneer2dx_ros/thermal_camera/image_raw &    
    $ rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py cmd_vel:=/pioneer2dx_ros/cmd_vel

## How to get an experience with sound  
You need 2 terminals for spawning a robot and controlling the robot.
At first, you have to install a gazebo that has sound function. See [here](https://github.com/m-shimizu/p3at_for_ros_with_modelsdf/wiki/Installing_Gazebo7).

    Terminal 1(To spawn a robot):  

    $ cd p3at_for_ros_with_modelsdf  
    $ source setup.bash  
    $ roslaunch gazebo_ros_sdf empty.launch world:=where_is_victim.world  
    (pioneer3at_ros will be spawned automatically)
    
    Terminal 2:  

    $ rostopic list
    $ rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py cmd_vel:=/pioneer3at_ros/cmd_vel
    (Which shell hide a victim? Search the victim by only her voice with pioneer3at_ros!)

## How to separate a game server and your robot control client
You have to do things following steps on two PCs. One PC(SERVER PC) is for the game server, another PC(CLIENT PC) is for your robot control client.  

__[On each PC]__  
  STEP.1: Synchronize two PC's clock.  
  STEP.2: Let each PC know another PC hostname and IP address by editing /etc/hosts.  

__[On the CLIENT PC]__  
  STEP.3: Run next command on the CLIENT PC to give ROS master host information to ROS packages on the CLIENT PC.  

    $ export ROS_MASTER_URL=https://<SERVER PC IP ADRESS>:11311  

__[On the SERVER PC]__  
  STEP.4: Spawn gazebo with empty.world. If you need, you can use another world. As you know, roscore is running on the SERVER PC.  

    $ cd p3at_for_ros_with_modelsdf  
    $ source setup.bash  
    $ roslaunch gazebo_ros_sdf empty.launch world:=where_is_victim.world  

__[On the CLIENT PC]__  
  STEP.5: Run your robot control client software. For example, like a following line. You must hear sounds from gazebo on the SERVER PC.     

    $ cd p3at_for_ros_with_modelsdf  
    $ rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py cmd_vel:=/pioneer3at_ros/cmd_vel
    $ roslaunch audio_play play.launch ns:=gazebo  

__-MEMO-__  
(read this, if you are interested in sound transferring with ROS between two PCs)   
In side of empty.launch, a capture.launch is calling to bring the SERVER PC's sound to  the CLIENT PC's ROS. A parameter "device" must to be set as "pulse" to capture "monitor of builtin sound" that gazebo output sound into.  

    <include file="$(find audio_capture)/launch/capture.launch">  
      <arg name="ns" value="gazebo"/>  
      <arg name="device" value="pulse"/>  
    </include>
