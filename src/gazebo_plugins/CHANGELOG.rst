2.5.3 (2016-04-11)
------------------

2.5.2 (2016-02-25)
------------------
* Fix row_step of openni_kinect plugin
* remove duplicated code during merge
* merging from indigo-devel
* Merge pull request `#368 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/368>`_ from l0g1x/jade-devel
  Covariance for published twist in skid steer plugin
* gazebo_ros_utils.h: include gazebo_config.h
  Make sure to include gazebo_config.h,
  which defines the GAZEBO_MAJOR_VERSION macro
* Fix compiler error with SetHFOV
  In gazebo7, the rendering::Camera::SetHFOV function
  is overloaded with a potential for ambiguity,
  as reported in the following issue:
  https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issues/1830
  This fixes the build by explicitly defining the
  Angle type.
* Add missing boost header
  Some boost headers were remove from gazebo7 header files
  and gazebo_ros_joint_state_publisher.cpp was using it
  implicitly.
* Fix gazebo7 build errors
  The SensorPtr types have changed from boost:: pointers
  to std:: pointers,
  which requires boost::dynamic_pointer_cast to change to
  std::dynamic_pointer_cast.
  A helper macro is added that adds a `using` statement
  corresponding to the correct type of dynamic_pointer_cast.
  This macro should be narrowly scoped to protect
  other code.
* gazebo_ros_utils.h: include gazebo_config.h
  Make sure to include gazebo_config.h,
  which defines the GAZEBO_MAJOR_VERSION macro
* Use Joint::SetParam for joint velocity motors
  Before gazebo5, Joint::SetVelocity and SetMaxForce
  were used to set joint velocity motors.
  The API has changed in gazebo5, to use Joint::SetParam
  instead.
  The functionality is still available through the SetParam API.
  cherry-picked from indigo-devel
  Add ifdefs to fix build with gazebo2
  It was broken by `#315 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/315>`_.
  Fixes `#321 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/321>`_.
* Fix gazebo6 deprecation warnings
  Several RaySensor functions are deprecated in gazebo6
  and are removed in gazebo7.
  The return type is changed to use ignition math
  and the function name is changed.
  This adds ifdef's to handle the changes.

------------------
* update test world for block laser
* this corrects the right orientation of the laser scan and improves on comparison between 2 double numbers
* Initialize ``depth_image_connect_count_`` in openni_kinect plugin
* multicamera bad namespace. Fixes `#161 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/161>`_

* Contributors: Dejan Pangercic, Ian Chen, John Hsu, Jordi Pages, Toni Oliver, Ugo Cupcic

2.3.4 (2013-11-13)
------------------

* Simplify ``gazebo_plugins/CMakeLists.txt``
  Replace ``cxx_flags`` and ``ld_flags`` variables with simpler cmake macros
  and eliminate unnecessary references to ``SDFormat_LIBRARIES``, since
  they are already part of ``GAZEBO_LIBRARIES``.
* Put some cmake lists on multiple lines to improve readability.
* Add dependencies on dynamic reconfigure files
  Occasionally the build can fail due to some targets having an
  undeclared dependency on automatically generated dynamic
  reconfigure files (GazeboRosCameraConfig.h for example). This
  commit declares several of those dependencies.

2.4.0 (2013-10-14)
------------------

2.3.3 (2013-10-10)
------------------
* gazebo_plugins: use shared pointers for variables shared among cameras
  It is not allowed to construct a shared_ptr from a pointer to a member
  variable.
* gazebo_plugins: moved initialization of shared_ptr members of
  GazeboRosCameraUtils to `GazeboRosCameraUtils::Load()`
  This fixes segfaults in gazebo_ros_depth_camera and
  gazebo_ros_openni_kinect as the pointers have not been initialized
  there.
* Use `RenderingIFace.hh`

2.3.2 (2013-09-19)
------------------
* Make gazebo includes use full path
  In the next release of gazebo, it will be required to use the
  full path for include files. For example,
  `include <physics/physics.hh>` will not be valid
  `include <gazebo/physics/physics.hh>` must be done instead.
* Merge branch 'hydro-devel' of `gazebo_ros_pkgs <github.com:ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs>`_ into synchronize_with_drcsim_plugins
* change includes to use brackets in headers for export
* per pull request comments
* Changed resolution for searchParam.
* Don't forget to delete the node!
* Removed info message on robot namespace.
* Retreive the tf prefix from the robot node.
* synchronize with drcsim plugins

2.3.1 (2013-08-27)
------------------
* Remove direct dependency on pcl, rely on the transitive dependency from pcl_ros
* Cleaned up template, fixes for header files

2.3.0 (2013-08-12)
------------------
* enable image generation when pointcloud is requested, as the generated image is used by the pointcloud
* gazebo_plugins: replace deprecated boost function
  This is related to this `gazebo issue #581 <https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issue/581/boost-shared_-_cast-are-deprecated-removed>`_
* gazebo_plugins: fix linkedit issues
  Note: other linkedit errors were fixed upstream
  in gazebo
* gazebo_ros_openni_kinect plugin: adds publishing of the camera info
  again (fixes `#95 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/95>`_)
* Merge pull request `#90 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/90>`_ from piyushk/add_model_controller
  added a simple model controller plugin that uses a twist message
* renamed plugin from model controller to planar move
* prevents dynamic_reconfigure from overwritting update rate param on start-up
* removed anonymizer from include guard
* fixed odometry publication for model controller plugin
* added a simple model controller plugin that uses a twist message to control models

2.2.1 (2013-07-29)
------------------
* Added prosilica plugin to install TARGETS

2.2.0 (2013-07-29)
------------------
* Switched to pcl_conversions instead of using compiler flags for Hydro/Groovy PCL support
* fixed node intialization conflict between gzserver and gzclient. better adherance to gazebo style guidelines
* Fixed template
* removed ros initialization from plugins
* Standardized the way ROS nodes are initialized in gazebo plugins
* Remove find_package(SDF) from CMakeLists.txt
  It is sufficient to find gazebo, which will export the information about the SDFormat package.
* ROS Video Plugin for Gazebo - allows displaying an image stream in an OGRE texture inside gazebo. Also provides a fix for `#85 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/85>`_.
* patch a fix for prosilica plugin (startup race condition where `rosnode_` might still be NULL).
* Added explanation of new dependency in gazebo_ros_pkgs
* switch Prosilica camera from type depth to regular camera (as depth data were not used).
* migrating prosilica plugin from pr2_gazebo_plugins
* Removed tbb because it was a temporary dependency for a Gazebo bug
* SDF.hh --> sdf.hh
* Added PCL to package.xml

2.1.5 (2013-07-18)
------------------
* Include <sdf/sdf.hh> instead of <sdf/SDF.hh>
  The sdformat package recently changed the name of an sdf header
  file from SDF.hh to SDFImpl.hh; this change will use the lower-case
  header file which should work with old and new versions of sdformat
  or gazebo.

2.1.4 (2013-07-14)
------------------

2.1.3 (2013-07-13)
------------------

* install diff_drive and skid_steer plugins
* Added dependency to prevent missing msg header, cleaned up CMakeLists
* Added ability to switch off publishing TF.

2.1.0 (2013-06-27)
------------------
* gazebo_plugins: always use gazebo/ path prefix in include directives
* gazebo_plugins: call Advertise() directly after initialization has
  completed in gazebo_ros_openni_kinect and gazebo_ros_depth_camera
  plugins, as the sensor will never be activated otherwise
* Merge pull request `#41 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/41>`_ from ZdenekM/hydro-devel
  Added skid steering plugin (modified diff drive plugin).
* Merge pull request `#35 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/35>`_ from meyerj/fix_include_directory_installation_target

* Combining Atlas code with old gazebo_plugins
* Small fixes per ffurrer's code review
* Added the robot namespace to the tf prefix.
  The tf_prefix param is published under the robot namespace and not the
  robotnamespace/camera node which makes it non-local we have to use the
  robot namespace to get it otherwise it is empty.
* findreplace ConnectWorldUpdateStart ConnectWorldUpdateBegin
* Fixed deprecated function calls in gazebo_plugins
* Deprecated warnings fixes
* Removed the two plugin tests that are deprecated
* Removed abandoned plugin tests
